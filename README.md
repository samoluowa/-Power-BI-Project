I then opened the file in Power BI and using the transform file tool in Power BI I cleaned the data.
First thing I did was to remove the columns that were not useful: Browser	,OS	,City	,Country	Referrer	,Time Spent.
Secondly I used the  Current Yearly Salary (in USD)	Column to create a new column which is the Average salary column. 
Afterwrads i then Clean the data in Q11 - Which Country do you live in?, Q4 - What Industry do you work in?, and Q5 - Favorite Programming Language	
Afterwards I created the dashboard in the file "" in Power BI
